        Star Wars is a science-fiction franchise comprising movies, books, comics, video games, toys, and animated shows. It is a fictional universe created by George Lucas. The Star Wars story employs archetypal motifs common to science fiction, political climax and classical mythology, as well as musical motifs of those aspects. As one of the foremost examples of the space opera subgenre of science fiction, Star Wars has become part of mainstream popular culture, as well as being one of the highest-grossing series of all time. It is currently the second highest-grossing film series behind only the Marvel Cinematic Universe and also the second highest-grossing media franchise of all time (with only the Japanese franchise Pokémon outranking it).

            <h3>Luke Skywalker</h3>
            <p>
            Jedi whose coming of age and rise as a Jedi are portrayed in the original Star Wars trilogy. Son of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, and Leia Organa's twin brother.[245] After the Galactic Empire's defeat, Luke becomes a Jedi Master and opens a Jedi Academy, but later goes into exile on the planet Ahch-To and cuts himself off from the Force, after the Academy and all its students are destroyed by his nephew, Kylo Ren, the son of Leia and Han Solo, who had fallen to the dark side. He is eventually found by Rey, the secret granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine, whom he reluctantly agrees to train, and later uses the last of his powers to face his nephew during the Battle of Crait, before dying peacefully and becoming one with the Force. His spirit later helps Rey gain the motivation necessary to face Palpatine, and, after she and the Resistance defeat the Final Order and the Sith, restoring peace to the galaxy, he appears to Rey alongside Leia's spirit when she visits his old home on Tatooine and assumes her role as a Skywalker.
